# BigWig
This repository contains some smaller BigWig files that are used as custom tracks in the UCSC Genome Browser. The files are hosted on GitHub and can be accessed directly from the browser. 

The files are used to visualize single-cell RNAseq and single-cell ATAC-seq data from skin of developing mouse embryos. The data was generated by the Van Otterloo Lab at the University of Iowa and can be explored [here](https://sites.google.com/view/vanotterloo/home).
